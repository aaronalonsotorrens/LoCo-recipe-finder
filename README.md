## Introduction

Welcome to my third project, part of the Code Institute Full Stack Development Course. The purpose of this project is to build a responsive website using python.

The code is a recipe finder. This is supposed to be a convenient and easy-to-use tool that helps you discover new meal ideas based on the ingredients you already have at home. The user will then have an option to add a recipe to the database to help other users find new recipes.

## Strategy

How many times have we come back from a long day at work we look in our fridge and we just stare without knowing what to cook. This code is supposed to solve that issue. Put those ingredients on the app and make those decisions go away.

## UX - User Experience Design

The 5 planes of UX are the following:

- The Strategy Plane
- The Scope Plane
- The Structure Plane
- The Skeleton Plane
- The Surface Plane

### The Strategy Plane

1. As the owner

- I want give the user choices between salty or sweet 

- I want the user to be able to see what recipes are available when they insert the ingredeints

- I want errors indicating if the input is not correct and guide the user on how to solve the issue

- I want the user to have the option to see the list of all ingredeints needed for the recipe chosen

- I want the user to feel engaged by allowing to contribute by adding their own recipes

2. As a customer

- I want to have an easy tool to guide me through the different steps to find a suitable recipe

- I want to see the options available with the ingredeints inserted and then give all ingredients part of that dish

- I appreciate being able to contribute to the app and having clear indications on how to do so
